# Nature Explorer Program

At Adventures Preschool, we believe that children can learn by being actively engaged, by playing and by experiencing. Our certified Nature Explore outdoor classroom provides children with meaningful opportunities to connect with nature while developing essential skills.

## Our Journey to Certification

We started exploring nature in 2014 with monthly walks, recognizing the value of outdoor learning. Our director attended the Nature Explore Conference in 2018, which inspired us to pursue outdoor classroom certification and create our intentionally designed outdoor learning space.

- Safe opportunities for physical challenge and motor development

### Musical Expression
