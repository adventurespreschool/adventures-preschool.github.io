### About Jill

Jill Strawhacker has been the heart of Adventures Preschool for over a decade. Her warm, nurturing approach creates a classroom environment where children feel safe to explore, question, and grow. With a Master's degree in Early Childhood Education from Iowa State University, Jill combines academic expertise with a genuine love for teaching young children.

### Teaching Philosophy

"I believe every child is a natural scientist, artist, and storyteller," says Jill. "My role is to provide the materials, time, and encouragement they need to explore these identities. When children lead their own learning through play, they develop not just academic skills, but confidence, creativity, and joy in discovery."
