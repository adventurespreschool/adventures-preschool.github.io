### About Jamie

Jamie O'Donnell joined Adventures Preschool as an assistant teacher, bringing her love of children and community involvement to our classroom. As a proud parent of two Adventures alumni, Maddie and Drew, Jamie has experienced firsthand the transformative power of our play-based, nature-focused approach. Her connection to the school runs deep, and she's passionate about providing the same nurturing environment for current students that her own children enjoyed.

### Teaching Approach

Jamie's warmth and enthusiasm create an inviting atmosphere where children feel comfortable exploring and taking risks. She excels at building relationships with each child, learning their unique interests and helping them discover new passions. Her background as an Adventures parent gives her valuable insight into the family perspective, making her a natural bridge between home and school.

### Community Connection

Living in Ames with her husband Mike, Jamie is deeply involved in the local community. The family are devoted Cyclone fans, attending Iowa State football and basketball games throughout the year. This community spirit extends into the classroom, where Jamie helps children understand the importance of being part of something larger than themselves.

### Personal Interests

When she's not in the classroom, Jamie enjoys:
- **Reading**: Always has a book recommendation ready
- **Gardening**: Grows vegetables and flowers, often sharing seeds and plants with the class
- **Kayaking**: Loves exploring Iowa's rivers and lakes
- **Hiking**: Discovering new trails with family and friends
- **Travel**: Exploring new places and cultures with her family

### Why Adventures?

"Watching Maddie and Drew thrive at Adventures showed me the magic that happens when children are given the freedom to learn through play," Jamie shares. "Now I get to be part of creating those experiences for other families. Every day, I see children discover their capabilities, make friends, and develop a love of learning that will last a lifetime."
