## Welcome to Adventures Preschool

Adventures Preschool is more than just a place where children come to learn – it's a vibrant community where young minds flourish through play, exploration, and discovery. As a parent cooperative preschool in Ames, Iowa, we've been nurturing children's natural curiosity and love of learning for over 30 years.

### Our Mission

To provide a nurturing, play-based learning environment where children develop confidence, creativity, and a lifelong love of learning through active engagement with their world, meaningful relationships with peers and adults, and daily connection with nature.

### What Makes Us Special

#### **Parent Cooperative Model**
As a parent co-op, families are integral partners in their child's education. Parents contribute their time, talents, and perspectives, creating a rich, diverse learning environment. This collaborative approach ensures:
- Lower student-teacher ratios
- Diverse learning experiences
- Strong home-school connections
- A supportive community network

#### **Nature-Based Curriculum**
Our certified Nature Explore outdoor classroom is central to our educational philosophy. Children spend significant time outdoors every day, regardless of weather, because we believe that:
- Nature provides endless learning opportunities
- Outdoor play develops resilience and problem-solving skills
- Environmental stewardship begins in childhood
- Fresh air and physical activity support healthy development

#### **Professional Excellence**
Our teachers are experienced early childhood educators who:
- Hold degrees in Early Childhood Education or related fields
- Participate in ongoing professional development
- Create individualized learning experiences
- Partner with families to support each child's growth

### Our Values

- **Play is Learning**: We recognize play as children's primary vehicle for understanding their world
- **Individual Growth**: Each child develops at their own pace, and we honor these differences
- **Community Connection**: Strong relationships between children, families, and teachers create the foundation for learning
- **Environmental Responsibility**: We nurture children's connection to nature and teach sustainable practices
- **Inclusive Environment**: We celebrate diversity and ensure all children feel valued and included

### Community Involvement

At Adventures Preschool, we believe in teaching children the importance of giving back to their community. Throughout the year, our students participate in various service projects, including food drives and community outreach programs.
